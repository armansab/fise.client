This is the `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ client for 
`FISE <http://wiki.iks-project.eu/index.php/FISE>`_  (Furtwangen IKS Semantic 
Engine). FISE offers a RESTful API to communicate with.

A good `introduction an overview of FISE features <http://blogs.nuxeo.com/dev/2010/08/introducing-fise-the-restful-semantic-engine.html>`_ 
has been written by Olivier Grisel. 

There are three kinds of communication:

engines
    stateless interface, submit content to the fise engines and get the 
    resulting enhancements formatted as RDF at once without storing anything on 
    the server-side.

store
    Upload content to the store and in a second step get the enhancements back.
    
sparql
    access FISE as a SPARQL endpoint (W3C conform)
